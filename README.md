Recommendations for the COVID-19 analysis done. 

1.Public Health awareness: The public should be well informed of the virus, how it spreads and measures taken to curtail its spread. Maintain consistent data tracking and early intervention strategies to help Nigeria respond more rapidly to any similar pandemics.


2.Targeted Testing and Surveillance: Given the variability in new cases, ramping up testing during peak transmission periods could help isolate cases early and control spread, especially as cases mirror global trends.
  
3.Improved Case Reporting: Death cases are relatively low, establishing more comprehensive reporting could provide a true picture of the pandemic’s real impact, improving response planning for future health crises.

4.Global Health Strategies alignment: Due to Nigeria’s case trends being aligned with global patterns, adopting international best practices in case management, vaccination, and public health policy would  be effective.
